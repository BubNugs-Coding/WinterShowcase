# Adding Santa Survival Screenshots

Please save the three screenshots from your browser as:

1. **Menu screen with leaderboard** → `assets/santa-menu.png`
2. **Gameplay screen (flying Santa)** → `assets/santa-gameplay.png`  
3. **Krampus' Infinite Night mode** → `assets/santa-krampus.png`

## How to save:
1. Take screenshots of the game at those three screens
2. Save them to the `assets/` folder with the names above
3. The showcase page is already configured to display them

The HTML and CSS are already set up in `index.html` and `styles.css`.
